# Nexus Platform with Docker Support, behind Nginx

This is a template for deploying Nexus Repository Manager and IQ Server behind an NGINX proxy to offload SSL using Docker Compose

I also add a few aliases to my /etc/hosts file to simulate DNS from outside of docker host but this is accessible over http wtihout them. If you're on Windows the file is here, c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.

```
127.0.0.1      localhost iq-server.mycompany.com repo.mycompany.com registry.mycompany.com
```

## Operations

In addition to Docker Desktop, I recoomend install Kitematic to help with managiong containers and seeing into logs.

I run Jenkins as a local app which allow it to hit the Nexus repo through Nginx so Docker repos work

The demo-setup script is a one time script to config docker and npm within NXRM; prior to running, review the docker-compose file and the persistent volume mounts. They are set to work on a linux machine and will need to be changed for a windows based machine. If you look at the script you can see it starts the environmetn with a docker-compose up -d and then creates and runs a few setup scripts once NXRM is responding to traffic.
```
./demo-setup.sh
```

To stop, use docker-compose:

```
docker-compose down
```

Subsequent runs can use docker-compose without the build for nginx or the need to create the persistent folders:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## URL's

- Nexus Web UI with SSL accessible via https://repo.mycompany.com
- Nexus Web UI over http via http://localhost:8081
- Docker proxy group registry accessible via https://registry.mycompany.com
- Docker Private Registry accessible via https://registry.mycompany.com:5000  (push)
- IQ Server accessible via http://localhost:8070 or https://iq-server.mycompany.com

## Persistent Volumes

I've create a convention of putting all of the persistent volumes is a hidden folder in the users home folder
```
~/.demo-pv
  + /iq-data
  + /iq-logs
  + /nexus-data
```
It's not clear to me how these work on a windows machine but check your settings for shared drives in Docker Settings. For info check out Getting Started at: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/

## IQ Server Configuration

There is a config.yml in the IQ-Server folder which is where you can customize the config to work with a SMTP, JIRA and Proxy servers.

## SSL Certificates

The Ngnix docker image build process generates insecure SSL certificates with fake location information and CNAME of localhost. Understand the risks of using these SSL certificates before proceeding. A deployed solution should use a valid CA certificate.


## Dynamic Configuration

Working examples of how to provision a new blobstore and create docker repos using it are in here and part of the setup. There are also placeholders for other formats like Maven, nnpm, etc...
